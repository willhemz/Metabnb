# Metabnb website

A site developed by `Williams Balogun`

## Process

- Firstly, ensured I had latest versions of **nvm**, **node** and **yarn** installed.
- Then, I set up my development environment using `create-react-app`.

* So, I removed dependency and files not needed in the project that \
  was included by default.
* Next step was to install the necessary dependencies. Dependencies \
  integrated into this project are:
  - react-router-dom
  - react-icons
  - Tailwindcss
