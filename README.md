# Metabnb website

A site developed by `Williams Balogun`

## Process

- Firstly, ensured I had latest versions of **nvm**, **node** and **yarn** installed.
- Then, I set up my development environment using `create-react-app`.

* So, I removed dependency and files not needed in the project that \
  was included by default.
* Next step was to install the necessary dependencies. Dependencies \
  integrated into this project are:
  - react-router-dom
  - react-icons
  - Tailwindcss dependencies (tailwind, autoprefixer, postcss)
    - The tailwindcss was then initiated and configured for the \
      project
    * Two tailwind config file exists. The tailwind.config.js and \
      tailwind-default.config.js. The first is where all added styling suffixes are added.
* Then, the Red Rose font was imported to be used in the project as \
  the default font character of the text.
* A route folder was then created inside the src folder to contain:
  - Home.js
  - Places.js
  - Footer.js
  - Root.js
  * subpages folder containing:
    - About.js
    - Wallet.js
    - PhotoSlides.js
